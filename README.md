- 👋 Hi, I’m @DetroitLibertyPenguin
- 👀 I’m interested in Free Software, particularly aimed at federate/SoS models, Android Apps, and Free Software for Windows. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to properly contribute to GitHub without any meaningful programming experience nor desire to learn more. (I took JAVA classes in college and decided I liked the idea of coding a lot more than I liked coding)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects I already use IRL. 
- 📫 How to reach me here, of on the 'verse https://libranet.de/profile/fu (my profile there includes a couple other ways to contact)
